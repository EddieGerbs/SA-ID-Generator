A South African ID number is a 13-digit number and follows this format:
YYMMDD SSSS C R N

Each part has a specific meaning:

YYMMDD: The first six digits represent the date of birth of the person, formatted as YYMMDD. 
This encodes the year, month, and day of birth.
YY: Last two digits of the year of birth.
MM: Month of birth (01 to 12).
DD: Day of birth (01 to 31).

SSSS: The next four digits represent a serial number that encodes gender:
For females, the number ranges from 0000 to 4999.
For males, the number ranges from 5000 to 9999.

C: The 11th digit represents citizenship:
0 for South African citizens.
1 for permanent residents.

R: The 12th digit is a historical race classification digit:
Under apartheid, this digit was used to denote race, but it is no longer relevant. 
Modern ID numbers use 8 in this position.

N: The 13th digit is the check digit, which is calculated using the Luhn algorithm. 
This digit is used for validating the ID number and ensuring it is correctly formatted.
